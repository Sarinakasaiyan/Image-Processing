Image Processing 

[Image Quantization]

This code saves an image at different quality levels and then displays the saved images simultaneously. Its purpose is to show the impact of varying quality on the image.

[Convert RGB Image To Binary]

This code reads an RGB image and converts it to grayscale. It then applies thresholding to convert the grayscale image into a binary image and displays both the input and output images side by side.

[Cropped]

This code reads an image, crops a specified region, applies Gaussian blur to the cropped area, and saves the blurred image. It then displays the original, cropped, and blurred images side by side for comparison.

[Upsampling]



This code reads an image and upsamples it by a factor of 2 using bilinear interpolation, improving its resolution. It then saves the upsampled image and displays both the original and upsampled images side by side, with axes visible for reference.
