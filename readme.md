---

[Histogram Matching]


The code performs histogram manipulation on an image by applying a wide Gaussian distribution with a high `sigma` and a low center, resulting in significant changes to pixel intensities. This transformation produces a final image that can appear drastically brighter or darker, along with a histogram that reflects these alterations.
